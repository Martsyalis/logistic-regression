Ann produced consistant result of 92% While logistical regression produced a 89% 

reducing the batch size to 8 seemed to help, perhaps due to small size of the data. 6-8 neurons seemed optimal, number of layers didnt matter, and 50 epochs were plenty 

batch size and number of neurons seems the most consequential variables with ann in these classification samples
